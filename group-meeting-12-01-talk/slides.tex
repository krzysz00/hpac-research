  \frametitle{Project goal}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Automatic generation of \{expression equality checker, normalizer, property inference\}
  \item Current code is fragile and hard to extend
  \item Something easier to add to would be nice
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Initial approach: rewrite rules}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Use completion algorithm to make a confluent rewrite system
  \item Confluence: apply rules in any order and get some results
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Consider $y + x + -x \to y$ on $x + -x + -(-x)$.
    \item Can get $-(-x)$ or $x$ as final result
    \item Need to add $-(-x) = x$ to fix
    \end{itemize}
  \item (Done) Base Knuth-Bendix algorithm and syntactic unification
  \item (Near done) Associative-commutative completion and unification
    \begin{itemize}
    \item One small bug in there somewhere maybe
    \end{itemize}
  \item (\textbf{Failed}) Rewrite rules conditioned on properties
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Trying to represent these as unconditional equations gets unwieldy and prevents sensible results
    \item Also, associativity only sort of works ($(AB)C \to A(BC)$ does not cover all cases)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{The future: theorem provers?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Property inference and equality checking are all first-order logic things
  \item We could delegate that to a theorem prover, potentially
  \item Could also enable more stuff like bandwidth properties (generalization of diagonal, triangular, etc.)
  \item Potential tools
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Prolog (might not be expressive enough)
    \item E (first order logic, but nothing else --- we'd need to roll our own $\mathbb{N}$)
    \item SMT solvers like z3 (seem to be very well developed, may not solve our problem)
    \item Coq \emph{et al} don't fit our problem type
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
